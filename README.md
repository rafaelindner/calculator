# Calculator with JS

This was a project in which i was inspired by a video i watched, i used HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

### I used the basic mathematical operations of a calculator: 
- Multiplication( * ) 
- Division( / ) 
- Subtraction ( - ) 
- Addition ( + )
### And the operations to delete digits are:
- C (clear)
- CE (cancel entry)
- DEL (delete last digit).

### It was very challenging for my learning!
